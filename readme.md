# My C++ Practice

Im doing these small projects to build my understading of C++ concepts since most of my learning has been with javascript & python most of the time.

I found this link to 50 C++ projects I can work on. I know these don't just apply to C++ but foundational understanding of programming in general.

I want to chanellege myself to get better at C++ since I would like to work with more low level coding in the future and potentially my career!
